ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => vocalizerSample\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => vocalizerSample\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi\libNuanceVocalizer.so => vocalizerSample\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi\libNuanceVocalizer.so
* libs\vocalizerlib.jar => vocalizerSample\libs\vocalizerlib.jar
* lint.xml => vocalizerSample\lint.xml
* proguard.cfg => vocalizerSample\proguard.cfg
* res\ => vocalizerSample\src\main\res\
* src\ => vocalizerSample\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
